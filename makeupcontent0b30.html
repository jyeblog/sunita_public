Concealer is stronger than foundation and do allow full coverage for pigmentation and trouble dark/light spot. It can be used before or after the foundation, but avoid using it once the foundation has been set with powder. Due to the transpancy of the skin under the eyes it tend to appear dark, so it is good to use liquid concealer under the eyes. Dab a small amount and pat gently with your ring finger (do not drag) and blend.<br><br><i>&nbsp;Important:</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <i>Always use good quality concealer (one shade lighter than your foundation).
</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   2. <i>Use eye cream before applying a concealer for a better and smooth application around eye area
