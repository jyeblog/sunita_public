Blush should be applied to the fullest part of your cheek. So smile big and simply brush on your blush while you are smiling using sweeping upward strokes for smooth application.<br><br>Â <i>Important:<br></i><ol><li><i>There should be no stripes of color, so pay attention to proper blending.</i></li></ol></p></div></div></div
