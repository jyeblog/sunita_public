Using a sponge, foundation brush or your clean fingertips blend the foundation following your natural hair growth (downwards) to your jaw line with very light strokes and blend it onto your neck to avoid a line. Apply a little on your ears as well.<br><br>&nbsp;<i>Important:<br></i><ol><li><i>Always choose the color of your foundation matching with your natural skin tone. Check the shade on your jaw line for a proper match. Always use natural light to check the shade.</i></li><li><i>Start by applying a small amount of foundation first, than layer it to achieve the look suits your natural skin color.
