You can apply loose powder several times without looking caked on.

Dip a powder brush in powder and shake the excess of it and go over entire face and neck with light strokes. Powder can be used without foundation over your moisturizer for a sheen/sheer look.

      <br><i><br>Important:

         <br></i><ol><li><i>Always use a powder at least three shades lighter than your foundation.</i></li><li><i>If there is any appearance of fine liner or wrinkles (usually it is around the eye), avoid using powder around that area.</i></li><li><i>Blend all lines or creases of foundation before applying the powder as it is very hard to fix the creases once has been set with powder.
